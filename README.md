# Async Performance Scenarios
 
This is a sample project to test the various incarnations of async/sync calls.

Why have I created this?

There are always a lot of discussions over the internet regarding this 'hot topic', but what I am trying to achieve is 
a) demystify async 
b) add some metrics to then make more informed decsions to an approach.

These scenarios aim to show different ways of coding using Tasks, async and System.Threading.
